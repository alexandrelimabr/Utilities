This is a test program on how to use the COM Digifort Player control only for DAS test pourposes.

1) In order to run this sample,  first you will neeed to register all .dlls in the host computer, since they are COM Libraries.
2) You can add more cameras and servers by updating the appconfig section of the app.config file.
3) Currently the program does not change dinamially between different servers, it does only change dinamically between cameras from the same server. This would be a next improvement on this test program.
